# Awesome books: with ES6

## Overview

In this project, you will restructure your [Awesome books app code](https://github.com/fmanimashaun/Awesome-book). The goal is to make it more organized by using modules while practising the use of ES6 syntax in the project

## Project Tasks List (Work-in-progress)

- [ ] Re-create the [Awesome books app](https://github.com/fmanimashaun/Awesome-book) following the rules:

  - [ ] Use ES6 syntax.
  - [ ] Divide your code into modules. Save each module in a separate file in the modules dir. Import modules in the index.js file. For this exercise - the more modules the better!
  - [ ] Keep all funcionalities of the app without errors.
  - [ ] Refactor your methods and functions to arrow functions.
  - [ ] Use let and const in a correct way.

- [ ] Display the current date below the navigation bar.

  - [ ]  For this requirement we use a library [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/install?id=es6)
  - [ ]  Download the script and save it to your project.
  - [ ]  Import it as a module.
